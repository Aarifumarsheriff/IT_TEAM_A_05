Develop an intelligent and efficient Multi-Person Attendance Detection System that
leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to accurately and automatically
track the presence of individuals in various environments.In various settings such as
classrooms, conferences, workplaces, and events, keeping track of attendance is a crucial
task. Traditional methods involving manual attendance marking or bar code scanning are
time-consuming, error-prone, and not well-suited for scenarios with a large number of
attendees. This system should be capable of identifying and recording attendance for multiple
individuals simultaneously, overcoming challenges related to occlusion, varying lighting
conditions, and diverse camera perspectives. The aim of this project is to create a robust, realtime
system that automates the attendance tracking process using computer vision and machine learning.
